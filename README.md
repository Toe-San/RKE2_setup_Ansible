Ansible RKE2 (RKE Government) Playbook
---------
[![LINT](https://github.com/rancherfederal/rke2-ansible/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rancherfederal/rke2-ansible/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

RKE2, also known as RKE Government, is Rancher's next-generation Kubernetes distribution. This Ansible  playbook installs RKE2 for both the control plane and workers.

See the [docs](https://docs.rke2.io/) more information about [RKE Government](https://docs.rke2.io/).


Platforms
---------
The RKE2 Ansible role only supports CentOS and Red Hat, but will eventually support all [RKE2 Supported Operating Systems](https://docs.rke2.io/install/requirements/#operating-systems)

Currently supported:
```yaml
CentOS:
  - 7.8
  - 8.2
Red Hat:
  - 7.8
  - 8.2
```
TODO: Add Support for
```yaml
Ubuntu:
  - bionic
  - focal
```


System requirements
-------------------

Deployment environment must have Ansible 2.9.0+

Server and agent nodes must have passwordless SSH access

Usage
-----

First create a new directory based on the `sample` directory within the `inventory` directory:

```bash
cp -R inventory/sample inventory/my-cluster
```

Second, edit `inventory/my-cluster/hosts.ini` to match the system information gathered above. For example:

```bash
[server]
192.16.35.12

[agent]
192.16.35.[10:11]

[rke2_cluster:children]
server
agent
```

If needed, you can also edit `inventory/my-cluster/group_vars/all.yml` to match your environment.

Start provisioning of the cluster using the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory/my-cluster/hosts.ini
```

Kubeconfig
----------

To get access to your **Kubernetes** cluster just

```bash
ssh ec2-user@server_ip "sudo /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml get nodes"
```

Available configurations
------------------------
Server Configurations

| Options | Descriptions|
|---------|-------------|
| cis_15_enabled | Validate system configuration against the CIS 1.5 benchmark (default: false) |
| rke2_channel | Channel to use for fetching the desired RKE2 version.  (default: stable, available: latest, stable, v1.19, v1.18)
| rke2_config_token | Shared secret used to join a server or agent to a cluster. (default: Automatically created) |
| rke2_write_kubeconfig_mode | Write kubeconfig with this mode (default: "0644" ) |
| tls_san | Add additional hostname or IP as a Subject Alternative Name in the TLS cert ie. ["compute.internal", "branch.mil"] |

These variables can be modified in the specific roles (`{role}/vars/main.yml`) or can be set in your `inventory/cluster/group_vars/all.yml`


Uninstall RKE2
---------------
    Note: Uninstalling RKE2 deletes the cluster data and all of the scripts.
The offical documentation for fully uninstalling the RKE2 cluster can be found in the [RKE2 Documentation](https://docs.rke2.io/install/uninstall/).

If you used this module to created the cluster and RKE2 was installed via yum, then you can attempt to run this command to remove all cluster data and all RKE2 scripts.

Replace `ec2-user` with your ansible user.
```bash
ansible -i 18.217.113.10, all -u ec2-user -a "/usr/bin/rke2-uninstall.sh"
```

If the tarball method was used then you can attempt to use the following command:
```bash
ansible -i 18.217.113.10, all -u ec2-user -a "/usr/local/bin/rke2-uninstall.sh"
```
On rare occasions you may have to run the uninstall commands a second time.
